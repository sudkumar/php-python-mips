# Conditional switch statement
C Code:
    switch(i){
	    case 1: i++;
	    case 2: i += 2;
		break;
	    case 3: i += 3;
	    default: i = 2;
    }


MIPS Code:
# assuming $s1 = i
# in switch statements, we seperate conditions from condition body
# we create a dummy variable to capture the values of first case statement i.e. 1
    addi $t1, $zero, 1	# $t1 = 1
    bne $s1, $t1, LC2_COND	# if conditions evaluates to true i.e. case failed go to next case 
    # condition is true, so evaluate the body of this case
    j LC1_BODY
LC2_COND: addi $t1, $zero, 2
    bne $s1, $t1, LC3_COND	# go to next case if this case fails
    # case passed, go into the it's body
    j LC2_BODY
LC3_COND: addi $t1, $zero, 3
    bne $s1, $t1, LDEFAULT_BODY 	# this is the last case and if this fails, go to default or exit
    # case is passed, go into it's body
    j LC3_BODY

# body for cases. cases without break will continue to next case body till it founds a break
LC1_BODY: addi $s1, $s1, 1
LC2_BODY: addi $s1, $s1, 2
	j LEXIT
LC3_BODY: addi $s1, $s1, 3
LDEFAULT_BODY:  addi $s1, $zero, 2
LEXIT:
